// Section 1. //
// 1. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself //
    // - We should pay attention to this because it's easier to maintain, performs better, more readable, and is less buggy //
    // - programming tools we've learned to use DRY code are functions //

// 2.   // Const (constant) means that the variable is not going to change (ex. someones name). //
        // When you use the variable let, you can change that variable throughout the course of the program (ex. a persons age) . //
        // var (variable) isn't commonly used anymore, but was the oldest way of declaring a variable. //

// Section 2. //

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kelvin';
const f = false;
console.log(a<b);
